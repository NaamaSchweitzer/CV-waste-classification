        "### Q&A\n",
        "1.  **Which classes were targeted for augmentation?**\n",
        "    The minority classes targeted for augmentation were 'dirt' and 'liquid', as their initial instance counts (1418 and 494 respectively) were below the average instance count of 1975.00 across all classes in the original training set.\n",
        "2.  **Did the data augmentation process improve dataset balance?**\n",
        "    Yes, the data augmentation process significantly improved the dataset balance, especially for the targeted minority classes. The 'dirt' class increased from 1418 to 5672 instances, and the 'liquid' class increased from 494 to 1976 instances. The overall average instance count per class rose from 1975.00 to 5523.25. However, 'liquid' and 'trash' classes still remain below the new average, indicating room for further improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   Initially, the training dataset contained a total of 7900 instances across 4 classes, with an average of 1975.00 instances per class.\n",
        "*   The minority classes identified for augmentation were 'dirt' (1418 instances) and 'liquid' (494 instances), as they fell below the initial average.\n",
        "*   The data augmentation process applied the following transformations to images containing these minority classes:\n",
        "    *   Horizontal Flip\n",
        "    *   90-degree Clockwise Rotation\n",
        "    *   Brightness Adjustment (random factor between 0.7 and 1.3)\n",
        "*   A total of 1653 augmented images and their corresponding label files were generated, adding 14,193 new bounding box instances to the dataset.\n",
        "*   After augmentation, the combined dataset consists of 22,093 instances, with an increased average of 5523.25 instances per class.\n",
        "*   The class distribution dramatically improved for the targeted classes:\n",
        "    *   **dirt**: Increased from 1418 to 5672 instances.\n",
        "    *   **liquid**: Increased from 494 to 1976 instances.\n",
        "    *   **marks**: Increased from 3373 to 11830 instances (as images containing minority classes could also contain 'marks' instances which were then augmented).\n",
        "    *   **trash**: Remained at 2615 instances (as it was not a minority class and images primarily containing 'trash' were not augmented).\n",
        "*   Despite the significant improvements, the 'liquid' (1976 instances) and 'trash' (2615 instances) classes are still below the new average instance count of 5523.25.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The data augmentation successfully boosted the representation of the 'dirt' and 'liquid' classes, leading to a more balanced dataset overall, which is crucial for improving the performance of object detection models, especially for underrepresented categories.\n",
        "*   To achieve even greater balance, consider applying further targeted augmentation strategies specifically for the 'liquid' and 'trash' classes, perhaps using more aggressive augmentation policies or generating more augmented samples for these particular classes.\n"

        "    The minority classes targeted for augmentation were 'dirt' and 'liquid', as their initial instance counts (1418 and 494 respectively) were below the average instance count of 1975.00 across all classes in the original training set.\n",
        "2.  **Did the data augmentation process improve dataset balance?**\n",
        "    Yes, the data augmentation process significantly improved the dataset balance for the targeted minority classes, though not for non-targeted majority classes. The 'dirt' class increased from 1418 to 5672 instances, and the 'liquid' class increased from 494 to 1976 instances. The overall average instance count per class rose from 1975.00 to 3409.00. However, 'liquid', 'marks', and 'trash' classes still remain below the new average, indicating room for further improvement.\n",

        "*   The minority classes identified for augmentation were 'dirt' (1418 instances) and 'liquid' (494 instances), as they fell below the initial average.\n",
        "*   The data augmentation process applied the following transformations to images containing these minority classes:\n",
        "    *   Horizontal Flip\n",
        "    *   90-degree Clockwise Rotation\n",
        "    *   Brightness Adjustment (random factor between 0.7 and 1.3)\n",
        "*   A total of 1653 augmented images and their corresponding label files were generated. After refining the augmentation to only include minority class bounding boxes, 5736 new bounding box instances were added from the augmented data.\n",
        "*   After augmentation, the combined dataset consists of 13636 instances, with an increased average of 3409.00 instances per class.\n",
        "*   The class distribution after refined augmentation:\n",
        "    *   **dirt**: Increased from 1418 to 5672 instances.\n",
        "    *   **liquid**: Increased from 494 to 1976 instances.\n",
        "    *   **marks**: Remained at 3373 instances (as these were not minority classes and their bounding boxes were excluded from augmented labels).\n",
        "    *   **trash**: Remained at 2615 instances (as these were not minority classes and their bounding boxes were excluded from augmented labels).\n",
        "*   Despite the significant improvements for targeted classes, the 'liquid' (1976 instances), 'marks' (3373 instances), and 'trash' (2615 instances) classes are still below the new average instance count of 3409.00.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The refined data augmentation successfully boosted the representation of the 'dirt' and 'liquid' classes by only augmenting their bounding boxes, leading to a more focused balancing approach. This is crucial for improving the performance of object detection models, especially for underrepresented categories.\n",
        "*   The 'marks' and 'trash' classes were not directly augmented, leading to them now being below the new average. To achieve even greater balance, consider applying further targeted augmentation strategies specifically for 'liquid', 'marks', and 'trash' classes, perhaps using more aggressive augmentation policies or generating more augmented samples for these particular classes. Alternatively, the strategy could be adjusted to augment all bounding boxes in an image if any minority class is present, if the goal is general dataset expansion rather than strict class-specific balancing."

This structure ensures a robust and representative dataset for developing and assessing an object detection model for trash detection."
