The occurrences of each class are: `dirt` with 1418 instances, `liquid` with 494 instances, `marks` with 3373 instances, and `trash` with 2615 instances. This analysis indicates an imbalanced class distribution.\n",

        "*   The significant class imbalance, particularly the low number of instances for `liquid` (494) compared to `marks` (3373), could lead to biased model performance.\n",
        "*   Consider data augmentation techniques or oversampling for minority classes (`liquid`, `dirt`) and potentially undersampling for majority classes (`marks`, `trash`) to balance the dataset for improved model training.\n"
